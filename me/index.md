I’m Gurbinder. I am a Phd student and a technology enthusiast. I like to mess around with new technologies. My interests are in distributed systems, big data graph analytics and parallel computing. I aspire to learn and create things in my field.

I enjoy playing play soccer, listen to music, paint, sketch and read. I love FOOD; I love to try out new cuisines, so if you know of a good place for coffee, hit me up!

I like to learn languages. I know हिन्दी , ਪੰਜਾਬੀ  and english. I am trying to learn spanish, but still working on it.
